      <h1 id="narrations-and-ideas-for-alignit">Narrations and Ideas for AlignIt</h1>
<h2 id="level-1---find-the-focus">Level 1 - Find the Focus</h2>
<h2 id="task-1">Task 1</h2>
<p>Welcome to this optics education game,
where you will learn how to align optical elements.</p>
<p>Before you try your first aligment task, there are a few useful things to know:
In VR-mode you can use either the right or the left controler and you can teleport to a
location on the optical table by pushing the joystick forward and selecting a location on the table
to teleport to.
You can take a steps backwards by pulling the joystick or rotate your view by pushing it sideways.</p>
<p>Useful information and setting are found on the PANEL, situated above the screen.
On this panel you will also find buttons to toggle narrations and background music or to
repeat the current level or choose then next or previous one.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, the game is organized in levels, each of which consists of several tasks.
You will get points for each completed task to add up to the total points for the level.
If you make it to the top 10, your name will be shown in the leaderboard accessible via the &quot;Highscore&quot; button.</p>
<p>This game is NOT about speed but about ACCURACY of your movements.
More precisely stated: every COMPONENT MOVEMENT UPDATE costs you some points.</p>
<p>Let´s jump right into it with the first alignment task, which is to find the focus of a
planoconvex lens. You can grab any optical component by the pedestal disc near the optical table
or at one of the ARROWS restricting the movement to the direction it points to.</p>
<p>Once you find the focus, the border of the screen will turn GREEN,
and you should THEN press the green button with the label &quot;DONE&quot;.</p>
<p>To listen to this narration again, press the blue &quot;NARRATION&quot; button.</p>
<h2 id="task-2">Task 2</h2>
<p>Great! You managed to complete your first alignment task.
You can see the points you collected on the top line of the panel.</p>
<p>This time your task is a little more difficult since the lens can NOW be moved along two degrees of freedom.
Next to the screen, you will see some small labelled indicators. They can be very useful tools to help you with the alignment.</p>
<p>If all of them BUT the last one are shown in green, you should have completed your task and the side of the screen should turn green, and you can press &quot;DONE&quot;.</p>
<p>That last indicator visualizes the number of movements spent,
which gives you a rough idea about the score to expect.</p>
<h2 id="task-3">Task 3</h2>
<p>Fantastic! You completed the second alignment task!
Now we add ONE MORE degree of freedom. Note the little upwards-pointing arrow next to the lens mount which you can grab.</p>
<p>To move a component upwards, you can also simply grab the rod on which the lens sits.</p>
<p>Remember to monitor the indicators while adjusting.</p>
<h2 id="task-4">Task 4</h2>
<p>Wow! You also passed this test.
Now there are another two degrees of freedom, which are the ROTATIONS of the lens.
To control these rotations, you need to click the mounted lens,
which activates rotation-adjustment gizmos.</p>
<p>For rotation fine-control you should move your pointer far away from those rings after clicking but still holding the trigger.</p>
<p>Note that the focus quality of a plano-convex lens depends on which side its flat side points to.</p>
<p>The largest ray bending angles typically introduce the largest optical aberrations. Therefore the flat side of the lens should point towards the focus meaning towards the screen.</p>
<h2 id="task-5">Task 5</h2>
<p>Perfect! Of course in real life you typically cannot see the laser beam as nicely as you see it here.
Therefore we now deactivated this helpful visualization of light rays.
Lets SEE, if you can repeat the previous alignment task,
with only being able to see the laserspot on the screen.</p>
<h2 id="task-6">Task 6</h2>
<p>I am impressed. You completed all the tasks of this level.
Your final score is shown on the top right.
Maybe you even made it into the top ten?
You can check if your name is in the leaderboard,
by clicking on the purple &quot;HighScore&quot; button.
If you switch between levels, always the level-specific highscore is shown.
A second click hides the leaderboard.
Clicking &quot;Done&quot; again will get you to level 2.</p>
<h1 id="level-2---optical-axis">Level 2 - Optical Axis</h1>
<h2 id="task-1-1">Task 1</h2>
<p>This level is about a very essential idea in optical alignment, which is the definition of an optical axis.
In this first example, we assume that the optical axis was already defined by a well adjusted laser beam and your task is to establish a MEMORY of this axis
by passing the laser beam though two pinholes.</p>
<p>This allows you to always reestablish the optical axis, as longs as you do not modify these pinholes afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="task-2-1">Task 2</h2>
<p>Nice! Of course the pinholes typically need to be adjusted in both transversal coordinates.
Start with the pinhole closes to the laser. Position yourself upstream near the laser,
to get a nice view along the laser beam and see where its hits the first pinhole.</p>
<h2 id="task-3-1">Task 3</h2>
<p>Well done! Can you also do this without seeing the laser rays?
The spot should be faintly visible on the first pinhole, if it does not pass through it.</p>
<h2 id="task-4-1">Task 4</h2>
<p>We started with the optical axis predefined by a preadjusted laser. But in real life,
it is often the other way round and you are given two pinholes or adjustment targets of the same height.</p>
<p>You then have to adjust the height and direction of the laser to pass through both of these pinholes.
Remember to click on the laser to activate its rotation gizmo and also remember that
you can get a better accuracy by moving your controller far away from the rotation gizmo while still holding the trigger.</p>
<h2 id="task-5-1">Task 5</h2>
<p>Great! To make it even more realistic,
you NOW have to adjust all degrees of freedom of the laser.</p>
<p>Can you still align it by passing it through the two holes defining the optical axis?</p>
<p>To help you, we only made one of the iris apertures small.
Since this one is further away from the laser, we call this aperture the
&quot;angle&quot; aperture, whereas the closer aperture is called the &quot;position aperture&quot;.
By adjusting the angles of the laser, you can pass it through this &quot;angle&quot; aperture, keeping the front iris open, to complete this task.</p>
<h2 id="task-6-1">Task 6</h2>
<p>Now you can continue your beamwalk by closing the front aperture and adjusting the laser position to pass through it. This will, of course mess up the position at the second aperture, which you should again correct using the angles of the laser.
By iterating between the adjustments, you should be able to pass through both apertures even when they are quite small.
This principle is called a &quot;beam walk&quot; and we will see more of this in other levels.
Note that you can only complete the level, if the pinholes are below a certain miminmum size. Once this is achieved, the component whos requirement are met will also turn green and the &quot;component&quot; indicator on the indicator bar will take notice.</p>
<h2 id="task-7">Task 7</h2>
<p>This was impressive! Your score is saved.
Maybe you made it into the leaderboard?</p>
