We are a research group located at the [Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (LIPHT)](https://www.leibniz-ipht.de/en/homepage/) and the [Institute of Physical Chemistry at the Friedrich Schiller University](https://www.ipc.uni-jena.de/en/research-groups/heintzmann-group) in Jena, Germany.
The group is led by Rainer Heintzmann.

# Our Mission

Our group focuses both on developing novel methods and devices for light microscopy as well as on improving established techniques. 
We work on computational algorithms enhancing properties such as the resolution of microscopes using structured illumination (SIM).

Furthermore, We aim to support researchers around the world with imaging devices which are easy replicate. This includes low-cost (microscopic) imaging devices, but also image processing algorithms. See the [GitHub page of UC2](http://youseetoo.org) for further reference.

Recently, we started to work more on open source software regarding microscopy image processing in [Julia Lang](https://julialang.org/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/?q=&type=all&language=&sort=stargazers). See also [this software page](/software).

The [BioPOLIM](https://biopolim.de/) team is focussing on Anisotropy in Microscopic imaging in the Life and Materials Sciences
