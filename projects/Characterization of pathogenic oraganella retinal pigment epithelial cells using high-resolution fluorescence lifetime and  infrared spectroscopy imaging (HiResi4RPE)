In this project, we work on applying high resolution Image scanning Microscopy with Fluorescence lifetime Imaging (ISM-FLIM) to study major alterations in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells
that contribute to the development of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a condition which underlying chemistry is not fully understood. 
RPE granules will be examined by Structured Illumination Mircoscopy (SIM) for further classification.
Moreover, chemical characterization of these cells will be investigated using mid-IR Photo-Induced Force Microscopy (PiF-IR), a promising method that 
combines nanoscaled spatial resolution with localized spectroscopy.  
These results will be compared with clinical investigations.

This project is supported by a funded project by the by German Reseach Foundation (DFG) that aims to examine the pathogenic inception of this disease [HiResi4RPE 542825796] (https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/542825796?context=projekt&task=showDetail&id=542825796&).
