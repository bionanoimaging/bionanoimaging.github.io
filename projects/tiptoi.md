We use [_digital paper technology_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_paper) to create labels as small as 1 by 2 mm<sup>2</sup> and use them to identify various optical components. Due to their miniature size it is possible to label small components without obstructing their functionality. The second advantage is its low budget. The identification of the small labels is done with a kid toy [_tiptoi pen_](https://www.ravensburger.de/de-DE/entdecken/tiptoi). The label can be printed on a common laser printer. We programmed the tiptoi pen in a way that the pen gives various audio information about the queried optical component. (e.g. interference filter - type, spectral band, size, default storage place). Additionally, the database with the properties of the components together with the label ID can be linked free online lab management system [Quartzy](https://www.quartzy.com/).
